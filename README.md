# Glitch
C# scripts of the short animation film "Glitch".

# BlinkingLightScript
<b>public void Blink(float time, int count);</b>

time: waiting time between the light switches in seconds

count: amount of switches

Activates and deactivates the "Light" object, in order to create the illusion of blinking light.
